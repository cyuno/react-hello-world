# react-hello-world
working on several tutorials you run into installation problems with windows 10 node and the npm.
The file herein follows the instructions on https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html
in windows cmnd you should have already installed the latest version of node and the npm. In this case I am using node 
8.0.0 and npm 5.0.3. 

in cmd running as administrator
go to the directory you have created in explorer. 
In my case it was c:\Users...\JavaScript\React\react-tutorial\

npm install -g create-react app

I know there are various tutorials that say don't use the -g switch, but you need to use
it.

then type

create-react-app my-app (or whatever you want to call my-app. in my case i called it helloworld)

then change directory to your app:
cd my-app (or whatever you called your app)
in my case
cd helloworld

then type
npm start

The installation says modify src/App.js and reload.

I have loaded the src/App here
